#this is my brilliant working code
##exponential growth function
#value of growth rate
lambda = 1.2
#vector for holding state variable
N = numeric(10)
#initial value of N
N[1] = 10
#loop to calculate N over time Use t to index vector
for (t in 2:10){
  #store the values of N in a vector
  N[t] = lambda * N[t-1]
}#end of loop
#if plot has only 1 arguement it assumes it is a time series
plot(N)
